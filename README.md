# C# Windows Forms Application–Based Movie Rental System Leveraging OOP Concepts

This project is a C# Windows Application–based Movie Rental System designed to streamline and manage movie rental operations. The application features a clean and user-friendly interface that enables users to browse movies, register customers, manage rentals, and track returns with ease.

The system leverages core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular, maintainable, and scalable structure. These principles help organize the codebase efficiently, making it easier to extend functionality and manage application logic.

Key features include customer management, movie inventory handling, rental and return processing, and automated fee calculation. With its intuitive workflow and solid OOP architecture, the application offers a reliable and efficient solution for everyday movie rental management.
